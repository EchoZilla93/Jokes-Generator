## Description about project
In this project i was using these tools:
    1: React & Redux.
    2: React Local Storage
    3: Jest and Enzyme for testing purpose

## My Comments 
I know I could make this app to run without Redux , but was thinking that it will be better to show you guys 
what tools I know. It's the first time I was using Jest and Enzyme for writting the tests. Hope that you'll like my approach of this app. 
There are some things that I had struggle with:
        1. In redux action I didn't find the way to handle Promise. `(You can check my commented code and try to play with it. Maybe you'll have better luck than me :) )`
        2. Everytime I was thinking that I am good at css but found that I need more work with it. Tried to make it as cool as possible on this project.
        3. Implementing Local Storage and Redux in one app took more time than I was expecting. 
That's probalby all that I want to mention about my time spending on this code.
